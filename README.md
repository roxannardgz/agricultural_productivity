# Agricultural Productivity Analysis

 -- WIP --

 For this analysis, we will use the `Agriculture and Rural Development Data` from the <a href='https://data.worldbank.org/topic/1'> World Bank Group</a>, which includes measures of agricultural inputs, outputs, and productivity compiled by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.
